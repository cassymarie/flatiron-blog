Recently moved to Boulder, CO in July 2020 from Seatte, WA. Worked as Project Coordination Manager at a manufacturing company based out of Atlanta, GA.  I now do consulting work for them since I moved from Georgia in 2017.  

As a sagittarius, I do not know the meaning of relax.  I enjoy being creative, getting into lots of different crafts.  And if you give me any chance to travel I will take it!  My husband & I have visited 21/30 MLB stadiums (including some older stadiums as well).

## Flatiron Blog Posts

In 2020, I've decided to take back my life and attend a coding bootcamp.  I've previously attended coding workshops in Seattle until CoVID hit.  Once that happened, life threw us another curveball with my husbands job moving us to the Boulder, CO area this summer.  After getting settled in, it was time to take my life back.  I decided to join Flatiron School to continue my software developer journey.  Below you will find links to blog posts that will capture my journey as a full-time student at Flatiron School.
