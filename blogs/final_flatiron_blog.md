# Product Management and real world scenarios

With my background in construction project management, it is my goal to eventually obtain a Product Management position within the software industry. It is my point of view, that a good manager has empathy for those on their team.  To have an understanding of the situations they are facing within the project realm.

I used this project to get my feet wet at managing a project (even if it was for myself).  Let me tell you what, it's a bit more challenging than I realized!

## Dream Big! Plan Small.

I created a [GitHub project board](https://github.com/users/cassymarie/projects/1) to track both my Frontend [Yicketty](https://github.com/cassymarie/yicketty/projects) and my Backend [Yak](https://github.com/cassymarie/yak/projects) with different project boards and make issues to complete. 

I started first on my main board, creating User Stories for what I wanted my MVP to be.  I had a big goal, make multiple API calls, render about 10 different components (2 of which would be used on multiple pages) and then create a fully functional game play based on all this information that was provided, and the user can manipulate.

***Never going to live this down!*** *Prior to the start of this project, I had a conversation with my husband (who is already holds a senior position in the industry). I was throwing out ideas and got really excited about the thought of a baseball game, especially with opening day starting soon. As an over abmisious, naive software developer I made the assumption that I could have the project blocked out in 2 days.  **2 DAYS!**  Not gonna lie, I think on day 2 I was in tears because my code was not working properly.  My husband was only supportive, and talked me through the low points.  But now that 2 days has passed, I'm pretty sure the rest of my life anytime I ask how long something will take, I'm gonna hear 2 days!*

It was by day 3 that I had to take a step back and reorganize the obtainable goals.  I had to setup multiple Step Goals that I wanted to hit, and created seperate branches for each of those.  *I had a bit of fun keeping with baseball names, small joys!*

## How to accurately plan your time? 

How come two lines of code could take an hour or a day? How do we plan our time accordingly?

No doubt that with doing comes knowing.  As a new individual in the industry, I am not sure I have any words of wisdom on this.  Having a good plan laid out in the beginning is a good start.  But having fallbacks and room to adjust expected outcomes is probably a better realization. I'll keep aiming high and dreaming big, but just roll with the punches and unknowns and gain experience along the way.
