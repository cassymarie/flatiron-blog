# Why I decide to study Software Engineering...

## A little background in coding

During my career, I have taught myself many field related programs.  The way I learned was to touch everything I could, see what it does, try to break as much 'stuff' as possible and see the results.  

After I started to get into the company's processes, it drove me crazy on all the manual repetition that was happening.  That is when I learned all about the wonderful world of macros and Microsoft's attempt at coding in Visual Basic.  I would record macros and tear them apart, studying what they were doing and making changes to break it.  During my time working in Visual Basic, I taught myself basic concepts of coding and understanding how things relate. 
 

## Google knows it all, but only what I ask it

I've created many different automated workbooks and databases in Microsft VB.  As a self-taught Google-student I am so thankful for the resource. However, my code may not be written as efficiently as possible because Googling answers gets me to the 'make it work' stage but not the full understanding.

Moving into a Software Engineering bootcamp, will provide me with a greater understanding of all the parts of writing good clean code.  Setting things up properly from the beginning and with full intentions of what I plan to do, instead of piece-milling it together as I go. 

## Future hopes and dreams

It is my hopes to be able to create working apps, websites and databases for my current company.  Then branching out to our peer-group companies (9 similar non-competing company across the country) and continue consulting on a grander level.  

My husband and I have a dream of working together in the future.  He is currently a QAE at Amazon and welcomes the chance to break away from the corporate realm.  Our goal is to get a nice RV, travel the states and work remotely as a team.  The question I just need to ask myself as I complete this bootcamp, is how do I want to specialize my SE skill in the future.
