# Pain Points only make you stronger! 

Holy Hell Batman!! I thought it was smooth coasting prior to this last phase, boy was I wrong!! Honestly, to cram React/Redux/Thunk in such a short time frame is only doing the students a disservice, especially for all the money we've thrown down - but heck we can say we did it!

Im going to continue my pain points here of what I learned as I developed this project.  From the start of planning and what I thought to where I ended up (currently) and want to still get to prior to review. 

More to come...
